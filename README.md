# Tumors-classification.
Machine learning/data science project in Python Language.

In this project, the classification of tumors is done. The analysis show if the tumor is benign or malignant, according to some data of this disease.

Here, Python Language is used, besides some libraries, such as: Pandas, Sklearn.

Pandas: a libray used to manipulate and analyse data, in tabular form. Some examples are spreadsheets, datasets and dataframes, which can be created. Furthermore, it's also possible to extract statistical information about the dataframe.

Sklearn: contains machine learning algoritms, used in predictions and analysis. It also has datasets, which can be used to study informations about how data science works, and study AI concepts. This project used breast cancer dataset.

The project used KNN algorithm. This algorithm is from supervised learning. It works in many areas, such as images and videos recognition, finance and health industries.
KNN means K Nearest Neighbor, and works in classification and regression. In this project, KNN assumes that similar things exist near each other. It also uses math concepts to define this similarity.
